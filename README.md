  <summary><strong style="font-size: 1.5em;">How enemies spawn</strong></summary>
  GetEnemie() from EnemiesPool gets called from different components (EnemieRoomSpawner, BossRoomSpawner,
  EnemiesWavesSpawner) Despite pool, only EnemieRoomSpawner returns enemies to pool. So bosses are not pooled practically.
  Each enemie has an EnemySpawn component, on death, if the room is still available they are queued for respawn. This is
  how enemies keep respawning. Each enemie has an health component, this is how they get damage and calculate if they are dead.

  state, stopping walking and setting NavMeshAgent enabled via EnemieWalking component. EnemieTargetFollower is the one that sets
  NavMeshAgentSpeed according to enemie state. Enemie triggers onCanAttack event if it is close enough to player and EnemieAttack

  A level (world) is combination of rooms. Each room has a attribute to set if it is opened at
  level beginning or not. If it is not open by default, you need to open it via its LootDropArea component. You set needen
  loot data via this component. Safe rooms usually consist Dynamic objects such as ActionArea(for weapon upgrades). and
  CameraFocuser for changing virtual camera when in a safe room. 
  World also contains other elements, QuestController has the quests as a child object. They can be Quest or StepsQuest.
  In initialization, World inits these quests via QuestController. To complete a level, last (exit) ActionArea of level should
  call Finish() from WorldFinish component
  NOTE: this quests each contain a lot of logic for both visually and logically in EDITOR events, so when debugging, should take care.
  They contain ActionListInvokers as child objects and have those logic events defined in them. They are mostly about opening the related room,
  enabling the current puzzle etc.

### FollowCamera
CM camera that follows player. Responsible for transition of player when enters a new room
### Room:

### RoomChecker
Checks room every frame(?) and if rooms is changed also calls FollowCamera singleton for transition.
This is not world(whole level) but single room that world contains.

### UIManager
Kind of a mediator/god object for every possible ui in game. Gives a static instance for every UI canvas.

### GameController
Sets frame rate and holds states for game pause / in focus. At start, waits until WorldsController.cs
completes navmesh operations and then loads game start canvas and force updates all canvases. During game it holds
time elapse for all game modes (classic/hardcore/death match) and loads them during initialization.

### LevelController
At Start, inits world using WorldsController

### WorldsController
Responsible for instantiating and setting currentWorld, called from LevelController, gets world index from LevelController.
Calls LootLoader, WeaponsController, HatsController and inits them all. Also sets up navigation via NavigationController,
Gets it from currentWorld(World)

### WeaponsController
Controls the current weapon, also has all weapon data as enums, and for enums each upgrade data
is defined inside of that element.

### MenusQueueController
Controls popup order. Each ui in game is UIMenu and controlled via this component, so they are added to queue when
Open() is called and shown accordingly.

### NewUpgradeController
Responsible for adding upgrades via different methods (IAP, game currency), and updates each possible attribute;

### DetectRadar
Checks enemies around player after each update. Holds them in list. PlayerShooter selects the appropiate target then.
This logic is also updated with new taunt system, but has the old behaviour if taunt is not used.

### PlayerShooter
After fetching visible enemies from DetectRadar, it selects the current target. If there is an already selected one
and that enemy is still viable, uses that enemy without making any other calculations. Otherwise selects the nearest enemy. This is also
overriden by new taunt mechanic, but similar to DetectRadar, if it is not used it keeps the old behaviour.

### PlayerController
Moves player via rigidbody+velocity. Physics is updated via PhysicsSimulateController. It keeps values for
walk and rotate speed.

### PlayerAnimsController
Using the values from PlayerController, applies the relative animationSpeed.

### Bullet
Abstract base class for all other bullet types. It has bullet attributes such as bulletData, its damage, direction, 
shoot position, if its fevered etc. Each child class then (flame,staff,simple) implements its own move logic.

### EnemyLayer
Sets enemies layer on spawn according info it fetches from EnemieSpawnController

### PhysicsSimulateController
Disable auto physics and simulate physics manually, it allows to stop game
in times such as ad popup appear.

### EnemiesWalkController
Adds debug normals of enemies to see in game in editor mode.

### LootDropArea

### ActionArea
Similar to LootDropArea, but for this one you don't need to provide loop. Used for things like Chest, AdsHelper

### Chest
Similar to AdsHelper, after ActionArea progress complete, opens chest ui via ChestsCollectController. After that
user selects either free or rewarded loot from here.

### AdsHelper
Where we call random worker. After completing ActionArea progress, ActionListInvoker calls AdsHelper Deactivate(),
which calls current World's WorldHelpers to call ActivateRandomHelper() function of HelpersController

### WorldFinish
Calls DoFinishAction(int id) from PlayerFinishActions. Id is defined according to world.

### GameEventController
Responsible for registering all events globally. A new event is defined by creating a new GameEvent enum.

### UpgradeUIInstance
After corresponding ActionArea progress completed, this one opens a ui instance for selected upgrade enum
type (Weapons,Hats,Helpers)

### LoadingSceneController
Set last played story mode (hard or story mode) and load the SampleScene(game scene)
